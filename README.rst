# Titanic Passengers Data Visualization using D3Js

This is a simple javascript code that plots the Titanic Passengers Data in a scatterplot using different graphic variables (colors, shapes, opacity) in order to represent the different values. 


## Using it?

All you need it to run a local http server (example use Python - the command below). D3js is already in local.


```
python -m http.server
```
